Link to live demo: https://great-articles.onrender.com/

**Note: Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to deploy on Heroku as they ended the free tier. So, I had to deploy on Render.**

Note 2: On the free tier, Render keeps the server sleeping while there's no requests, so it might take a little bit long to access the app.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
